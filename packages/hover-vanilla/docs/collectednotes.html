                  <h1 id="from-dev-to-to-collected-notes">From dev.to to Collected Notes</h1>
                  <p><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/44o4l5.jpg" alt="Collected Notes, so hot right now"></p>
                  <p>I have been publishing notes an articles on <a data-size="large" target="_blank" href="https://dev.to">dev.to</a> for around a year and a half already. Although it&#39;s a great platform and there&#39;s a pretty nice community around it, I always wanted to have my own thing. Something simpler, just upload my content and that&#39;s it. No likes, no feeds, no related posts from other users. So I got very excited when <a href="https://twitter.com/esacrosa/">@esacrosa</a> announced Collected Notes and I was able to try out the alpha version 🎉</p>
                  <p>From now on I&#39;ll writing here on Collected Notes. And cross-post to <a href="https://dev.to">dev.to</a> most probably.</p>
                  <p>If I&#39;ll be writing here then I should have the rest of articles and notes from <a href="https://dev.to/gillchristian">dev.to/gillchristian</a> here as well.</p>
                  <p>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/RiccardoOdone">@RiccardoOdone</a> videos on <a href="https://youtu.be/XsgixFYo_Sc">scripting</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/PU9Gs-XRYEQ">with Haskell</a> and becase  both <a href="https://dev.to">dev.to</a> and Collected Notes have APIs I did what anybody would do, write some code to automate the process.</p>

                  <h2 id="the-script">The script</h2>
                  <p>I won&#39;t go into detail of how the script is implemented but I do think it is worth pointing out the libraries and tools involved:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li><a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/#script-interpreter">Stack script interpreter</a> allows to use Haskell for scripting, even to use libraries and a particular compiler version if needed</li>
                     <li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative">optparse-applicative</a> a command line options parsing with an applicative flavor 🌯</li>

It&#39;s the first time I use lenses so no idea what I was doing 🐶</li>
